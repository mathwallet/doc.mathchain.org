The security consideration of secretstore and smartwallet are:

The secret node is key to the security of smart wallet, and they are controlled by the MathChain. There will be 2 levels of attack may happen:

1 Control the validator of MathChain

Solution: because MathChain is the para-chain of Polkadot which means the attacker need to control most of the Polkadot validators. This is almost impossible to archive.

2 Control the secret node through MathChain governance

Solution: Any changes of MathChain including add/remove secret node need to go through MathChain governance. And same as Polkadot, there will be a council to vote the 1st round of governance proposal which means malicious proposal will be rejected at the council review and will not go to referendum phase.
